# Introduction
This repository provides source code for replication of TEGAN [1]. TEGAN could transform short-length SSVEP signals into long-length artificial SSVEP signals. With the assistance of TEGAN, the performance of traditional frequency recognition methods and deep learning-based methods could be significantly improved under limited calibration data. And the classification performance gap of various frequency recognition methods would be narrowed.

# Running Environment
